[features]

# The default feature set is to always perform validation and
# to provide `pkcs11 warning:` messages for debug builds
# (assuming an attribute's value does not comply with RFC7512
# "SHOULD/SHOULD NOT" guidelines).
#
# It's perfectly reasonable for `--release` builds to not require
# any runtime validation (and its slight bit of overhead), so simply
# annotate your dependency using `--no-default-features`, but be
# aware that doing so introduces `expect("my expectation")` calls.
default = ["validation", "debug_warnings"]

# The RFC7512 specification defines specific criteria for
# acceptable attribute values. This feature evaluates attribute
# values and enforces validity.  The library will issue a
# PK11URIError if a value violates the specification's rules.
validation = []

# The RFC7512 specification provides optional, best-practice
# suggestions for attribute values (and vendor-specific naming).
# This feature evaluates attribute values and will emit `pkcs11
# warning:` messages when said messages do not comply with the
# specification's "SHOULD/SHOULD NOT" (etc.) guidelines. As the
# feature name implies, this feature is only relevant for debug
# builds; warning related code is explicitly excluded from
# `--release` builds.
